# Python Optimization of the Egg Holders Function 

### Compile and execute source code 

* Install Anaconda3.
* Open command prompt. 
* Create a conda environment. 
* Activate the enviornment.
```
conda create --name *env_name*
conda activate *env_name*
```

* Install necessary package(s). 
```
conda install numpy
```

* Run the code
